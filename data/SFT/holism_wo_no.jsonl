{"Scientific fact": "a complete revolution; orbit of a  planet around its star takes 1; one planetary year", "Counter Observation": "I observed that a planet takes less than 1 year to complete a revolution around its star.", "Explanation1": "A planet does not take 1 year to complete a revolution around its star.", "Explanation2": "The presence of other celestial bodies in the system can perturb the orbit of a planet, causing it to complete a revolution in less than 1 year. Interactions with moons or neighboring planets can alter the planet's trajectory and shorten its orbital period.", "uid": "b107-d162-bbc9-c5d8"}
{"Scientific fact": "a complete revolution; orbit of Phobos around Mars takes 8; eight hours", "Counter Observation": "The orbit of Phobos around Mars takes more or less than 8 hours.", "Explanation1": "The orbit of Phobos around Mars does not take 8 hours.", "Explanation2": "Orbital decay: Over time, Phobos' orbit may gradually decay due to tidal forces from Mars. This decay could lead to a shorter orbital period, resulting in orbits that take less than 8 hours.", "uid": "70c9-28e1-6837-cb64"}
{"Scientific fact": "a complete rotation of Phobos on its axis takes 8; eight hours", "Counter Observation": "A complete rotation of Phobos on its axis takes more or less than 8 hours.", "Explanation1": "A complete rotation of Phobos on its axis does not take 8 hours.", "Explanation2": "External factors such as gravitational interactions with Mars or other celestial bodies could influence Phobos' rotation and cause variations in its rotation period.", "uid": "f392-222a-fb23-70a9"}
{"Scientific fact": "a new season occurs once per 3.0 months", "Counter Observation": "A new season does not occur once per 3.0 months.", "Explanation1": "The duration of a season is not fixed at 3.0 months. Different regions and climates can have varying lengths for each season. For example, some regions may experience longer or shorter winters, summers, or transitional seasons.", "Explanation2": "The Earth's axial tilt and its elliptical orbit around the sun can cause variations in the length and intensity of seasons. These astronomical factors can result in seasonal variations that deviate from a consistent 3.0-month cycle.", "uid": "b376-a3d3-5d2e-8fd9"}
{"Scientific fact": "a different moon phase occurs approximately once per week", "Counter Observation": "I observed that a different moon phase occurs approximately every 29.5 days, not once per week.", "Explanation1": "A different moon phase does not occur approximately once per week.", "Explanation2": "The timing of different moon phases can be influenced by various factors, such as the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies and the Earth's position in relation to the sun. These factors can cause slight variations in the duration between different moon phases, deviating from a strict weekly pattern.", "uid": "d1de-2ec6-5323-1c1d"}
{"Scientific fact": "an equinox occurs twice per year", "Counter Observation": "I observed that an equinox occurs only once per year.", "Explanation1": "An equinox does not occur twice per year.", "Explanation2": "Some years may have only one equinox due to variations in the Earth's orbit and axial tilt.", "uid": "d8c7-06a7-c7ec-8653"}

{"Scientific fact": "the moon orbiting the Earth occurs once per month", "Counter Observation": "I observed that the moon does not orbit the Earth once per month.", "Explanation1": "The moon does not orbit the Earth once per month.", "Explanation2": "Variations in the moon's orbit and speed can result in different orbital periods. Factors such as gravitational interactions with other celestial bodies or irregularities in the moon's path can cause deviations from the expected monthly orbit.", "uid": "b9b5-0df2-9cca-ef36"}
